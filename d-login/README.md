# Diego's Login and Registration System

https://github.com/realdiegopoptart/d-resources/tree/main/d-login

This isn't a resource where everything is 100% Complete, it is meant to be a ground foundation for more players to create servers on GTA Connected
The script purposely isn't done to be a solution, but rather as a guide and a boilerplate for future gamemodes/resources.

## How to use:
/login [password]

/register [password]
## Features:
Does not allow the player to use commands or chat without being logged in.
Can load and store basic information about the player
## Requirements:
MySQL Server Database
## Modules:
MySQL: https://github.com/VortrexFTW/mod_mysql

Hashing: https://github.com/VortrexFTW/mod_hashing
## Ideas you can add:
Freeze player or even show a matrix camera overlooking a city

Saving and loading a player's coordinates.

Admin level system

User control panel with a MySQL database connection to read information about a player on a site, discord bot, ect;


- Pull requests are welcomed to make things run smother and better (and maybe basic ideas/compatibility for more Connected games)
